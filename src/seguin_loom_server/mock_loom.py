class MockLoom(BaseMockLoom):
    """Simulate a Seguin dobby loom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    verbose : bool
        If True, log diagnostic information.

    Notes
    -----
    Standard loom commands and replies are of the form "=<cmdchar><data>":

    * cmdchar is uppercase for a command and lowercase for a reply,
      and many commands have matching replies, such as
      "=U<unweave?>" and "=C<shaft_word>".

    * The loom reports status with ``=s<status_word>``,
      where status_word is a hex string whose bits are:

        * 0: shed fully closed.
        * 1: not used
        * 2: next pick (=C command) requested
        * 3: error (as of 2025-01 this is not implemented
             by SÃ©guin, but is reserved for future use)

    * The loom reports nothing during a 2-cycle pick.

    * The loom silently ignores "=C<shaft_word>" if not requesting a pick.

    Out of band commands begin with "#" (the default in base_loom_server).

    Warning: I have assumed that bit 0 of status "shed fully closed"
    is set to 1 when moving to the requested shed is done, 0 otherwise.
    If this is wrong, and not simply inverted, then this loom
    does not report shaft motion, and I should change the code.
    See toika_loom_server for an example of a loom that does not
    report motion state.
