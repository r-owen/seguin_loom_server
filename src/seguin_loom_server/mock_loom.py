class MockLoom(BaseMockLoom):
    """Simulate a Seguin dobby loom.

    Notes:
        Standard loom commands and replies are of the form "=<cmdchar><data>":

        * cmdchar is uppercase for a command and lowercase for a reply,
        and many commands have matching replies, such as
        "=U<unweave?>" and "=C<shaft_word>".

        * The loom reports status with ``=s<status_word>``,
        where status_word is a hex string whose bits are:

            * 0: shed fully closed.
            * 1: not used
            * 2: next pick (=C command) requested
            * 3: error (as of 2025-01 this is not implemented
                by SÃ©guin, but is reserved for future use)

        * The loom reports nothing during a 2-cycle pick.

        * The loom silently ignores "=C<shaft_word>" if not requesting a pick.

        Out of band commands begin with "#" (the default in base_loom_server).

        Warning: I have assumed that bit 0 of status "shed fully closed"
        is set to 1 when moving to the requested shed is done, 0 otherwise.
        If this is wrong, and not simply inverted, then this loom
        does not report shaft motion, and I should change the code.
        See toika_loom_server for an example of a loom that does not
        report motion state.
